Package domain

This package contains to the INNER LAYER

Its responsible for the business logic and have to be framework independent!

    It contains always the packages:

        - executor
            -> executor is responsible for running the interactors in the Background.

        - interactors (use-cases) [the real business logic]
            -> small interactor classes (Single Responsibly Principle) are solving each one specific problem

        - model
            -> holds the data for the interactors in business logic format (e.g. no Cursor)

        - repository
            -> provides interfaces for outer layers so the interactors can access the data (repository pattern)
